# Virtualization and Containers

Learning goals:

- Name differences between virtualization and containers and name use cases for each.
- Create and modify virtual machines with VirtualBox and generate them with Vagrant.
- Create and manage Docker containers.
- Name containerization technologies beyond Docker and name their main differences.
